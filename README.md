In this C++ project, I utilized Blender and the OpenGL framework to recreate my room in a virtual environment.
Through a combination of programming and 3D modeling, I brought to life a part of my physical space, in terms of furniture.
This recreation offers an opportunity to explore and interact with my room digitally, providing a novel perspective on its layout and design.
By integrating advanced rendering techniques and user-friendly controls, the project showcases the potential of C++ in creating realistic virtual environments.
In order to create a more pleasent visualisation, I implemented a few lighting techniques and special effects such as fog and animation.
