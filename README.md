In this C++ project, I utilized Blender and the OpenGL framework to recreate my room in a virtual environment.
Through a combination of programming and 3D modeling, I brought to life a part of my physical space, in terms of furniture.

This recreation offers an opportunity to explore and interact with my room digitally, providing a novel perspective on its layout and design.
By integrating advanced rendering techniques and user-friendly controls, the project showcases the potential of C++ in creating realistic virtual environments.
In order to create a more pleasent visualisation, I implemented a few lighting techniques and special effects such as fog and animation.

Functionalities mapped to the buttons:

W,A,S,D	  directional movement
Q,E	      up-down movement
M	        show shadow map
1,2,3	    normal, wireframe and vertex view
4	        animation to present the scene
5	        toggle the second scene
Z,X	      increase-decrease the density of the fog
K,L	      rotate the directional light
Y	        toggle the cursor
R,T	      rotate the nanosuit object and the blades of the helicopter
M        	show shadow map
G,H	      toggle the point light on/off
